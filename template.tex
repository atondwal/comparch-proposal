\section{Introduction}

This document provides the submission and formatting instructions
for the camera-ready version of the papers accepted for
publication in the proceedings of the 45th Annual IEEE/ACM
International Symposium on Microarchitecture, 2012~\cite{micro45}.

\section{Preparation Instructions}

\subsection{Paper Formatting}

All submissions should contain a maximum of 12 pages of
single-spaced two-column text. You cannot purchase extra
pages. Exceptions may be made by shepherds.

If you are using \LaTeX~to typeset your paper, then we suggest
that you use the template available at the MICRO-45 website:
\texttt{http://www.microsymposia.org/micro45/}. If you are using
a different software package to typeset your paper, then please
adhere to the guidelines mentioned in
Table~\ref{table:formatting}.

\textbf{Do NOT include page numbers in the final version}. 

\subsection{Content}

\noindent\textbf{{Author List.}} Please include the names of all
authors along with their affiliation and email ID. Please refer to
the sample author block in this document.

\noindent\textbf{Figures and Tables.} Ensure that the figures and
tables are legible.  Please also ensure that you refer to your
figures in the main text. Many readers print the papers in
gray-scale. Therefore, if you use colors for your figures, ensure
that the different colors are distinguishable in gray-scale.

\noindent\textbf{Main Body.} Avoid bad page or column breaks in
your main text, i.e., last line of a paragraph at the top of a
column or first line of a paragraph at the end of a column. If you
begin a new section or sub-section near the end of a column,
ensure that you have at least 2 lines of body text on the same
column.
